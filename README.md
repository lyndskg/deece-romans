## Overview 

<ins>__Language__</ins>: Go 

<ins>__Completed on__</ins>: February 8th, 2023

<b>Roman</b> is a script that converts decimal numbers to roman numerals (and vice versa). It is a port of the CPAN-package [Roman](https://metacpan.org/pod/Roman), V1.24. 

Implementation is based on source code from [Chonla's Git repo](https://github.com/chonla/roman-number-go).

## To Do

Nothing! This project is fully implemented and tested.

## Usage

Run <b>Roman</b> with Go on the command line:

```
$ go run roman.go
```

In order to run tests (*i.e.* any files ending with `_test.go`) at the command line, run the `go test` command &mdash; with or without the `-v` verbose flag option.

```
$ go test 
```
